# VK_right_wing
In the repository, I am storing the code for the analysis of German right-wing groups on VK

In the framework of my dissertation at Free Universtiy of Berlin, I study how German right-wing groups exploit the affordances of Russian social media platform VKontakte. For studying functionality and thematic profiles of these online communities, I collected all textual and activity data from these groups. With the help of correlated topic modeling, I could extract the main themes discussed in the groups.
